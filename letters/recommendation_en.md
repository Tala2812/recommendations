This letter is to confirm that Natalia Guskova completed an internship at SMAIPL LLC from August 4 to November 17. During this period, she proved to be a detail-oriented, independent, and technically strong specialist.

Natalia demonstrated confident skills in working with AI tools, the ability to quickly adopt new technologies, and a strong commitment to delivering stable, production-ready results. Throughout her internship, she designed and implemented several practical modules that addressed real business needs, including:

an automated reply module for a group Telegram chat (monitoring incoming messages and generating keyword-based replies), which showed stable performance and improved internal communication control;

a text style rewriter that transforms any text into a specified tone (business, friendly, formal, creative) using OpenAI models;

a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation module to support long-term profitability assessment;

an interior redesign tool that generates improved design options based on an input photo and a chosen style (loft, minimalism, classic, Scandinavian), with well-structured inputs and outputs;

two color-related tools: an image-based palette generator and an “emotion palette” generator that creates color solutions from keywords, both featuring careful visualization and solid UX;

a font generator that fetches popular typefaces from Google Fonts and produces visual samples with usage recommendations;

a text emotion analyzer powered by OpenAI models;

two text/file voiceover tools using ElevenLabs that output ready-to-use .mp3 files;

an image generation and editing tool based on the Nano-Banana model via the Kie.ai API.

Natalia showed strong attention to detail, resilience under deadlines, and the ability to independently find optimal solutions. She also proved to be a responsible and communicative team member, consistently open to feedback and focused on delivering results.

I consider Natalia Guskova a strong and promising specialist, well-prepared to work with AI tools, multimodal systems, and applied solution development. I recommend her for roles related to process automation, AI integration, and intelligent product development.

Sincerely,
Dmitry V. Anashkin
